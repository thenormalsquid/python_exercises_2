# Python exercises part 2

A collection of exercises to do on my free time. The ultimate goal is to practice with python.

## Part 1: word ladder
A word 'ladder' is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time
with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word. Find the minimum
length 'ladder' between two words.

Note: I know one can use the Levenshtein distance or hamming distance to find this result but the goal is to practice python.

## Part 2: Generate random sentences
Build a n-gram from a provided input text/corpus and generate markov chain sentences with the n-gram and a 
context-free-grammer ruleset.
